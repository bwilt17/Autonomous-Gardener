# Autonomous-Gardener
A mechatronics course project designed to autonomously care for a potted plant. 

This project was designed and produced by Manraj Banghu and Beverly Wilt at San Jose State University in Spring 2021. Because of meeting constraints due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the project was done collaboratively online and two prototypes were made for testing, one for each team member.
