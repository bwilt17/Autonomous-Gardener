# Autonomous Gardener
A mechatronics course project designed to autonomously care for a potted plant.

## Project Overview 

This project was designed and produced by Manraj Banghu and Beverly Wilt at San Jose State University in Spring 2021. Because of meeting constraints due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the project was done collaboratively online and two prototypes were made for testing, one for each team member.

## Water Distribution Part Info

A part for this project to distribute water around the pot was designed in SolidWorks and 3D printed. Print specifications and 3D model files can be found under [CAD files](https://github.com/bwilt17/Autonomous-Gardener/tree/main/CAD%20files).

(UPDATE: 4/5/21) Part design needs to be modified to have longer stakes for better soil penetration OR soil level in final potted plant used must be specified to be no lower than approx. 1/2" from the top edge of the pot.
