# Water Distribution Part Info

A part for this project was designed in SolidWorks and 3D printed on a Kingroon KP3 3D printer in Hatchbox Black PLA filament. 
A SolidWorks part file and an STL can be found in this repository. 
The part attaches to the tubing output from the water pump to distribute water around the pot.

(UPDATE: 4/5/21) Part design needs to be modified to have longer stakes for better soil penetration OR soil level in final potted plant used must be specified to be no lower than approx. 1/2" from the top edge of the pot.
